# FS19_LoaderVehiclesAI

With this mod helpers will be able to drive your loader vehicles, just place the vehicle straight in front of the heap and press "H".
If you want to unload the material on the ground, press "CTRL + I" before you hire the helper.
The helper will keep to drive and load until he finds nothing left to load.
